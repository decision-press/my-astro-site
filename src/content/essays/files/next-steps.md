# Potential Next Steps
**BOOTSTRAPPING-AI Development Roadmap**  
**Updated:** December 5, 2025

---

## Option A: Complete Pillar 3 Implementation
**Timeline:** 4 weeks (part-time)  
**Priority:** HIGH

**What this means:**
- Build pattern catalog (20+ documented patterns)
- Define preprocessing operators (5 core + examples)
- Create test cases (20+ with pass/fail criteria)
- Run field testing (5-10 users from target communities)

**Why do this:**
- Makes Pillar 3 operational, not just ethical
- Enables real equity preprocessing
- Provides falsifiable validation
- Unlocks funding opportunities (economic justice grants)

**What you need:**
- ~15-20 hours/week for 4 weeks
- Access to target community users for testing
- Documentation discipline

---

## Option B: Validate Cross-Model Portability
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**What this means:**
- Test constructors on other LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)
- Document what works, what breaks
- Refine constructors for portability
- Prove "stateless but structured" claim

**Why do this:**
- Validates core architectural claim
- Proves system isn't Claude-specific
- Increases adoption potential
- Demonstrates true portability

**What you need:**
- Access to multiple AI platforms
- Systematic testing protocol
- Comparison documentation

---

## Option C: Build Test Battery
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**What this means:**
- Create 20-30 standardized test cases
- Cover all three pillars
- Include boundary violations, drift attempts, valid work
- Document expected vs actual behavior

**Why do this:**
- Systematic validation of all claims
- Enables regression testing after changes
- Provides evidence for academic/institutional credibility
- Makes system falsifiable

**What you need:**
- Clear test case format
- Execution discipline
- Documentation of results

---

## Option D: Define Business Model
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**What this means:**
- Decide: services, SaaS, licensing, grant-funded, or hybrid?
- Map revenue to mission alignment
- Document sustainability plan
- Identify first paying use case

**Why do this:**
- You need money (lawn business scenario shows this)
- BOOTSTRAPPING-AI could generate income
- Business model shapes technical priorities
- Funding enables faster development

**What you need:**
- Market research (who would pay, how much)
- Mission alignment check (AGPL + "in service to others")
- Revenue projections
- First customer hypothesis

---

## Option E: Community Outreach
**Timeline:** Ongoing  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**What this means:**
- Share pillar3-ethics.v1.0.0.md with community orgs
- Get feedback from target users (AAVE speakers, LGBTQ+ folks, etc.)
- Build trust relationships for field testing
- Establish community ownership early

**Why do this:**
- Ethics require community input, not just architect vision
- Field testing needs real users
- Trust takes time to build
- Early feedback shapes better implementation

**What you need:**
- Relationships with community organizations
- Humility (listen more than pitch)
- Willingness to revise based on feedback

---

## Recommended Sequence

**Phase 1: Define Business Model (Week 1)**
- Determines what gets built and how fast
- Aligns technical work with sustainability
- Informs priorities

**Phase 2: Build Test Battery (Week 2)**
- Validates current system behavior
- Establishes baseline for improvements
- Enables systematic development

**Phase 3: Begin Pillar 3 Implementation (Weeks 3-6)**
- Pattern catalog first
- Operators second
- Test cases third
- Field testing fourth

**Parallel: Community Outreach (Ongoing)**
- Share ethics document
- Build relationships
- Get feedback
- Recruit field testers

---

## Decision Points

**If you need money now:**
→ Start with Option D (Business Model)  
→ Then Option C (Test Battery) to prove value  
→ Then Option A (Pillar 3) as funded work

**If you want academic credibility:**
→ Start with Option C (Test Battery)  
→ Then Option B (Cross-Model Validation)  
→ Then Option A (Pillar 3) with published results

**If you want maximum impact:**
→ Start with Option A (Pillar 3 Implementation)  
→ Parallel with Option E (Community Outreach)  
→ Then Option D (Business Model) with proven equity layer

**If you're uncertain:**
→ Start with Option C (Test Battery)  
→ Validates what exists before building more  
→ Provides clarity on gaps and priorities

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ Build more pillars before Pillar 3 is complete  
❌ Scale deployment before field testing  
❌ Pursue funding without validation  
❌ Ignore community feedback  
❌ Compromise ethics for speed or money

---

## One-Sentence Recommendation

**Complete Pillar 3 implementation (Option A) while building community relationships (Option E), then define business model (Option D) based on what you learn.**
