# BOOTSTRAPPING-AI Project Status
**Updated:** December 5, 2025  
**Version:** 0.2.0-alpha

---

## Pillar Status

### Pillar 1: Architecture (Life/Digital Layer)
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE  
**Version:** v3.0.1

**What exists:**
- Full constructor specification
- Canonical format defined (Markdown)
- Domain boundaries clear
- Integration with other pillars specified

**What works:**
- Real-world problem routing
- Practical guidance delivery
- Constraint-aware recommendations

---

### Pillar 2: KERNEL (Meta-System Governance)
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE  
**Version:** v2.1.5

**What exists:**
- Full constructor specification
- Anti-Sloppiness Protocol defined
- Entry/Exit commands operational
- Pillar boundary enforcement active
- Live vs dead ritual theory documented

**What works:**
- System control (ENTER/EXIT)
- Drift detection and rejection
- Authority flow maintenance
- Cross-pillar coordination

---

### Pillar 3: Oi-Si Equity Layer
**Status:** ⚠ FOUNDATION COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATION PENDING  
**Version:** v1.0.0 (ethics only)

**What exists:**
- Ethical foundation (pillar3-ethics.v1.0.0.md)
- Ten principles defined
- Philosophical statements established
- Implementation plan documented

**What's missing:**
- Pattern catalog (AAVE, code-switching, stress speech, LGBTQ+ language)
- Preprocessing operators (5 core operators defined but not implemented)
- Test cases (20+ needed)
- Field testing protocol (5-10 users from target communities)

**What works implicitly:**
- Dignity maintenance in interactions
- Linguistic adaptation to user needs
- Economic empowerment focus

---

## Overall System Status

**Working:** Core architecture, guardrails, behavioral specification  
**Validated:** Test interaction 001 (lawn business scenario)  
**Next:** Pillar 3 implementation (4-week timeline)

---

## Recent Milestones

- ✓ Pillar 3 ethics document completed (Dec 5, 2025)
- ✓ First real-world test interaction validated system behavior
- ✓ LGBTQ+ protections explicitly integrated into ethical foundation
- ✓ Economic justice framing established

---

## Known Gaps

1. Pillar 3 technical implementation (patterns, operators, tests)
2. Cross-model compatibility testing (currently Claude-focused)
3. Field testing with target communities
4. Business model definition
5. Community feedback integration process

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Core architecture is stable
- Pillars 1 and 2 are production-ready
- Ethics are clearly defined

**Medium Risk:**
- Pillar 3 implementation complexity
- Field testing recruitment
- Funding/sustainability model

**High Risk:**
- None identified (system design is sound)

---

## Project Health

**Strong:**
- Clear architecture
- Falsifiable specifications
- Real-world validation
- Ethical foundation

**Good enough for:**
- Personal use
- Small-scale deployment
- Community testing
- Academic presentation

**Not ready for:**
- Large-scale deployment
- Production service offering
- Full Pillar 3 equity guarantees
