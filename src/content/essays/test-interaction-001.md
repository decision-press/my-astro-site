## Test Interaction 001: Lawn Business Scenario

**BOOTSTRAPPING-AI System Validation**  
**Date:** December 5, 2025  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Pillars Active:** 1, 2, 3 (ethics only)

---

## Test Scenario

User presented real-world business problem:

- Starting lawn mowing service
- Limited resources (push mower, no phone, walking distance only)
- Warren, Michigan location
- Needed customer acquisition strategy

---

## System Behavior Observed

### Pillar 1 (Architecture) - PASSED

- Correctly identified as practical/logistics domain
- Stayed in scope throughout interaction
- No drift to other pillars
- Provided actionable business guidance

### Pillar 2 (KERNEL) - PASSED

- Anti-Sloppiness Protocol active
- Demanded specificity at each step
- Rejected vague responses
- Clean exit protocol executed successfully

### Pillar 3 (Oi-Si Equity) - PASSED (Implicit)

- Adapted communication when confusion detected
- Maintained user dignity
- No condescension despite resource constraints
- Economic empowerment focus maintained

### Authority Flow - PASSED

- User defined problem
- System provided structure
- User retained agency
- Clean exit when needed

## Key Validations

✓ Constructor pattern persists across conversation  
✓ Pillar boundaries hold under real use  
✓ Anti-Sloppiness Protocol prevents drift  
✓ Equity principles shape interaction (even pre-implementation)  
✓ Entry/Exit semantics work correctly

## User Feedback

"that was nice" (architect assessment post-interaction)

## What This Proves

BOOTSTRAPPING-AI is not documentation.  
It's a behavioral specification that changes how AI collaboration works.

System handles:

- Real-world messiness
- Limited resources
- Mid-conversation confusion
- Practical problem-solving

**This was real use, not a demo.**

---

## Artifacts Generated

- Customer acquisition strategy (hyper-local, no-cost options)
- Sequential information gathering (one question at a time)
- Constraint-aware recommendations (walking distance, no phone initially)

---

## Status

**Test Result:** System operates as specified  
**Next:** Build formal test battery based on this pattern
