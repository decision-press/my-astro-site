    This page lives at <code>/about</code>. It shares the same layout as the
    home page, but carries different copy and purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    For now, think of it as the early witness log for The God Decision: a place
    where we prove to ourselves that the system compiles — technically and
    philosophically.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the structure matures, these routes can map onto the real TGD sections:
    the problem, the decision, the consequences, and the witness path.
